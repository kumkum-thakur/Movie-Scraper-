Scrape, Analyze, Enjoy: Dive Deep into Movie Data

The Movie Scraper project is designed to simplify the process of discovering and accessing comprehensive movie data. By leveraging web scraping techniques, this tool fetches detailed information about movies from the YTS website, including genres, IMDb ratings, likes, and torrent links for downloading.

The primary technologies i've used are:

1.BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML
2.requests for making HTTP requests
3.re for regular expressions
4.random for random selection
5.Python for overall programming
